  <h1>Learning to Love Git</h1>
  <h2>(...and quit doing manual version control!)</h2>
  <h4>October 26, 2015</h4>

  <section>
<p>Today was an exciting day: I did my first-ever Git push.</p>
<p>I had never taken the time before to dive in and start working with Git on the command line. I knew that GitHub existed, 
having heard developers I work with talking about it all the time, but the terms they threw around like "branch", "fork", "tag",
"push", and "pull" were all pretty fuzzy to me.</p>
<p>Well I'm thrilled to say that I've made not only my first commits, but also pushed changes to my own GitHub repo
and even merged a pull request.</p>
<p>No more manual version control for me! I used to rename files by date, and then by letter, to manually keep track of 
changes over time (oy vey!). Those days are gone. By using Git, I can keep directories tidy, switch between branches to 
test new code ideas, provide helpful explanations through messages for each commit, and even work with other developers using GitHub.</p>
<p>It's like Christmas in October! :-)</p>
